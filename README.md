```

# Realm configuration

After you run the bot for first time, send it `!info`. Get your ID and stop the bot.

Open ./data/config.lua and add your ID to the "sudo_users" section in the following format:
```
  sudo_users = {
    123456789,
    987654321,
    YourID
  }
```
Then restart the bot.

Open ./bot/seedbot.lua and in check_tag function change my tag @EricSolinas with yours, then if someone tags you in a group where there is your bot you will be notified in pm.

Write in pm to your bot `/installenstrings` (or `/installitstrings` if you are Italian), with that command the bot will install the text to interact, otherwise will send an error saying that it can't find the string of text

Create a realm using the `!createrealm` command.
